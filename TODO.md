  * DONE-Generate 128-bit random salt (32 hex chars)
  * DONE-Save to file ~/.dpass
  * DONE-Set permission to 600
  * Handle File.open errors
  * Handle File.chown errors
  * ???-Append new salts so old salts are not lost (w/ date?)

  * Check salt is hex
  * ???-Check that salt seems random (how?)

* Master password
  * DONE-Remove highline dependency
  * DONE-Clear from memory ASAP string.replace

* Input validation
  * Check HASH_ITER is reasonable before use
  * Check PASS_LENGTH is reasonable before use
  * Check SYMBOL_COUNT is reasonable before use
  * Check SYMBOLS.length is reasonable before use
  * Check SYMBOLS is reasonable before use
  * Check master password (min length, ???)

* Output password
  * Guarantee specified bits of randomness (SYMBOL_COUNT, PASS_LENGTH)
